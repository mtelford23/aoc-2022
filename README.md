# aoc-2022

Advent of Code is a online coding challenge that starts at the beginning of December every year and releases new coding challenges every day until Christmas. This year I decided to try my hand at it and I'm currently in the slow process of working through all 25 problems in a new-to-me language (Python). You can find my solutions here in this repository. 

START: December 3, 2022
FINISH: not done yet (:
