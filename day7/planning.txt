- "/" outermost directory
- "$" command
- "cd" change directory
	- "x" move in one level
	- ".." move out one level
	- "/" switches to the outermost directory
- "ls" prints all files and directories in the current directory
	- if something printed has a number in front of a string, that means that it's a file named the string with a size of the number

GOAL: find the directories with a total size of 10000 at the greatest and then sum those sizes. 

- object oriented
	- directory objects, as you traverse the given file, add into the outermost directory with the new ones
- arrays.
	- one array, contains other arrays that contain strings of the directory name and the files within it. 

looping through input file
if line contains "dir"
	make new array
	add name of dir to array
	until the line is a command or another dir, add each line to the new array
	if line is a command, break
	if line is a dir, add dir to array and break

find totals for each individual directory:
new array to store the totals and the name of directories 

for each in directories array:
	add other directories to another array
	split file strings, cast to int, add to 	array for file sizes
